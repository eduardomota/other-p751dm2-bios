## Readme / How To

1. Extract ZIP
2. Create an FREE-DOS USB flash-drive (To do so we recommend the Software 'Rufus').
3. Add all files without folder directly to the root of the flash-drive. 
4. Connect your Power Supply 
5. Remove old BIOS/HDD Passwords and disable UEFI
6. During boot press "F7" to select the flash drive.
7. Type "step1" and hit "Enter". (The system will auto-reboot)
8. Once again select the flash drive, type "step2" and hit "enter".         
9. Follow the on-screen instructions. (Confirm with yes in case of ID Mismatch)
(The system may beep during the flashing process, this is normal)
10. After the system has completed & auto-shutdown, remove AC Power for 30s
(The first boot takes a little longer and it will automatically reboot.)
11. Press F2 to Enter the BIOS Setup Menu and press F3 to load the setup defaults.
12. Make important changes like UEFI & RAID to match your previous setup.
